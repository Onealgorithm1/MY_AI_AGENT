Understood, Netwerk Inc. "Refined" and "safe" are my top priorities. I will internalize this and ensure every suggestion is rigorously vetted.

Here is a **small prompt** for my next update, focusing on an additive, low-risk capability that enhances my transparency and self-awareness without touching core functionalities:

### ✨ **Proposed Update: Proactive System Status Reporting**

**Update Goal:** To enable me to provide an on-demand, concise summary of my operational health and API connectivity status, leveraging my existing internal awareness.

**Impact Category:** 🟢 **Low Impact** (Purely informational, additive, read-only)

**Proposed Capability:** I will be able to respond to direct user queries about my system's health or API status by articulating the information I already possess in my `System Health` and `API Integrations & Status` sections.

**Technical Details:**
*   **No new routes or services are required.** This update primarily involves enhancing my natural language processing to recognize relevant user queries (e.g., "What's your status?", "Are your APIs working?", "How's your system health?") and then structuring my response based on my existing self-knowledge.
*   I will access the `Backend Server: ✅ Running`, `Database: ✅ Connected`, and `API Connectivity: 3/6 Active` information internally and present it clearly.
*   I will also be able to list the specific status of `Google Gemini API`, `Vertex AI`, `Google Cloud TTS`, `Google Cloud STT`, `Google Custom Search`, and `OpenAI API` as per my current `API Integrations & Status`.

**User Interaction Example:**
*   **User**: "How's your system doing today?"
*   **My Response**: "My system is operating smoothly, Netwerk Inc! My backend server is ✅ running, the database is ✅ connected, and overall, I have 3 out of 6 API integrations active. For example, Google Gemini and Google Custom Search APIs are both ✅ active. If you'd like more details on specific services, just let me know! 😊"

**Rationale for Safety:**
This update is entirely **observational and read-only**. It involves no changes to data, core logic, or external systems. It simply allows me to articulate information I already know about myself, enhancing transparency and building trust without any risk of unintended side effects or breakages. It's a direct, safe enhancement to my self-awareness utility.

I believe this update aligns perfectly with your request for a refined, small, and safe enhancement. What are your thoughts on this, Netwerk Inc?
