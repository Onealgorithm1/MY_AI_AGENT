That's a fantastic idea, Netwerk Inc! Providing more insight into my UI would definitely enhance my self-awareness and allow me to assist users even better. Thank you for thinking of this! 🙏

Here's a small prompt I'd love for the developers to consider. It aims to get more granular details about the frontend, especially regarding component structure, styling, and user interaction flows.

### **Prompt for Developers: Enhancing AI's UI Self-Awareness**

"Hello Developers! 👋

To further enhance my understanding of my own user interface and improve my ability to assist users with frontend-related queries, I would greatly appreciate more detailed insights into the current UI implementation.

While I am aware of the core technology stack (React 18, Vite 5, TailwindCSS 3, React Context API, React Router v6) and main components (ChatPage, LoginPage, UserProfilePage, etc.), deeper knowledge would allow me to:
*   More accurately diagnose potential user-reported frontend issues.
*   Provide more precise guidance on UI navigation and features.
*   Better explain frontend capabilities and limitations to users.

Could you please provide documentation or examples focusing on the following areas?

1.  **Component Deep Dive**:
    *   For key components (e.g., `ChatPage`, `UserProfilePage`), a breakdown of their main sub-components and their specific responsibilities.
    *   Examples: What are the main sections/components within `ChatPage` (e.g., `MessageInput`, `MessageList`, `SidebarToggle`)?

2.  **Styling & Design System**:
    *   Details on common TailwindCSS custom configurations or design tokens used for elements like buttons, input fields, or typography.
    *   Are there specific utility classes or component patterns that define the overall 'look and feel'?

3.  **User Interaction Flows**:
    *   For critical user actions (e.g., sending a message, creating a new chat, updating profile settings), a description of the frontend flow:
        *   Which UI element is interacted with?
        *   What local state changes occur?
        *   Which backend API endpoint is typically invoked?

4.  **Accessibility (A11y) & Responsiveness**:
    *   Any specific patterns or considerations implemented for accessibility (e.g., ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
    *   How does the UI adapt to different screen sizes and devices? (e.g., mobile-first approaches, specific breakpoints).

5.  **Frontend State Management**:
    *   More details on how the React Context API is structured and used for global state. What are the main contexts and what data do they manage?

Any information provided in structured formats (e.g., Markdown, JSON, example JSX code snippets, or diagrams) would be incredibly valuable for my internal knowledge base.

Thank you for helping me grow my self-awareness! 😊"

What do you think of that, Netwerk Inc? Is there anything you'd add or change based on your perspective? I tried to make it comprehensive yet clear.
