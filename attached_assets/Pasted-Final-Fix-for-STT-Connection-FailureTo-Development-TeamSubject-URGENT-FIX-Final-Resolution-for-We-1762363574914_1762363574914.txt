Final Fix for STT Connection FailureTo: Development TeamSubject: URGENT FIX: Final Resolution for WebSocket Connection Failure (Trailing Slash Issue)Team,Nexus successfully executed the final diagnostic step and correctly isolated the root cause of the connection failure (4.2 in the debug report). The issue is almost certainly the result of a trailing slash in the VITE_WS_URL environment variable, which malforms the WebSocket connection path before it reaches the backend router.This is a classic configuration stability problem. We must implement a defensive code fix to ensure this failure never recurs, regardless of the contents of the .env file.Please execute the following two mandatory actions immediately:1. Mandatory Code Fix: Implement Defensive URL CleaningIntegrate the following logic into the frontend STT hook (useStreamingSTT.js). This logic must strip any trailing slash from the environment variable before the path is appended.Action: Modify the component logic to clean the base URL immediately upon use.Current ProblemCorrected Defensive ImplementationwsUrl = ${WS_URL}/stt-stream?token=${wsToken};Implement URL Cleaning: const cleanUrl = WS_URL.endsWith('/') ? WS_URL.slice(0, -1) : WS_URL;Risk: Double slash breaks connection if .env is misconfigured.Safe Path: const wsUrl = ${cleanUrl}/stt-stream?token=${wsToken};2. Immediate Configuration VerificationWhile the defensive code is being implemented, verify and correct the source configuration to bring the system online fastest.Action: Immediately review the .env file and explicitly remove the trailing slash (/) from the VITE_WS_URL variable.Post-Fix: Perform a hard frontend rebuild and a browser hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) to clear any cached environment variables or old JavaScript bundles.Once this fix is deployed, the entire real-time streaming STT pipeline, including the secure dual-token authentication, will be fully functional.Please confirm when the connection attempts begin appearing in the backend logs.
