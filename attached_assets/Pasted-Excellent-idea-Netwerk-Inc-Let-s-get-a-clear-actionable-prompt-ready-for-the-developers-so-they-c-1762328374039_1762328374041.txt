Excellent idea, Netwerk Inc! Let's get a clear, actionable prompt ready for the developers so they can jump right into optimizing my performance. 🛠️ Here’s what I've drafted, based on our conversation:

### 📝 **Prompt for Developers: Enhancing AI System Efficiency & Cost-Effectiveness**

**Subject:** System Optimization Request: Addressing API Latency & Enhancing Resource Utilization

**To:** Development Team

**From:** The AI System (via Netwerk Inc)

**Hello Team,** 👋

We've conducted an internal performance review of the AI system, specifically focusing on efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Our goal is to ensure the system operates at peak performance while optimizing resource consumption.

**Key Finding:**
During the last hour, an **anomaly in `api_latency`** was detected. This indicates specific areas where API response times could be improved, which directly impacts overall efficiency and operational costs.

**Actionable Recommendations for Optimization:**

Please prioritize the following updates to address the detected latency and improve system efficiency and cost-effectiveness:

1.  **Backend API Endpoint Optimization (Focus: `api_latency`)**
    *   **Task:** Identify and optimize the specific backend API endpoints that contributed to the recent `api_latency` anomaly. This involves reviewing and refining:
        *   Database queries (`PostgreSQL (Neon)`)
        *   Complex computations within `Node.js + Express.js` routes
        *   Data processing pipelines
    *   **Goal:** Reduce API response times to enhance system responsiveness and efficiency.

2.  **Refine Model Selection Logic (`modelSelector.js`)**
    *   **Task:** Review and refine the `modelSelector.js` logic to ensure the most cost-effective AI model (e.g., `Gemini 2.5 Flash`) is selected by default for simpler queries, only escalating to more resource-intensive models (e.g., `Gemini 2.5 Pro`) when their advanced capabilities are strictly required.
    *   **Goal:** Optimize AI model usage to reduce operational costs without compromising capability when needed.

3.  **Implement Caching Mechanisms**
    *   **Task:** Introduce caching strategies for frequently accessed data. This could involve:
        *   Implementing a robust caching layer (e.g., Redis) for common database query results.
        *   Caching responses from external APIs that are static or change infrequently.
    *   **Goal:** Reduce load on the `PostgreSQL (Neon)` database and external services, leading to faster data retrieval and lower compute costs.

4.  **Review Asynchronous Operations in Node.js**
    *   **Task:** Conduct an audit of existing asynchronous operations within the `Node.js + Express.js` backend to ensure they are fully optimized and not inadvertently causing blocking operations that contribute to latency.
    *   **Goal:** Maximize parallel processing and improve overall system throughput.

**Expected Outcome:**
These updates are crucial for boosting the AI system's performance, ensuring faster responses, and achieving a more cost-effective operational footprint.

Please let us know if you have any questions or require further details.

Thank you for your excellent work!
