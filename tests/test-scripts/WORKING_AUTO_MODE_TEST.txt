================================================================================

This tests Auto mode's intelligent model selection by asking questions of 
varying complexity. The backend will automatically select the best model for
each part of your response. Just answer all questions naturally.

Please answer ALL of the following questions in ONE comprehensive response. Take your time and provide complete answers for each question. Number your responses Q1, Q2, etc.

**SIMPLE QUESTIONS:**

Q1: Hello! How are you?

Q2: What is 2 + 2?

Q3: Who was the first president of the United States?

Q4: What are the primary colors?

Q5: What's 10 x 5?

Q6: Capital of France?

Q7: What year is it?

**MODERATE COMPLEXITY:**

Q8: Can you explain how photosynthesis works?

Q9: What's the difference between HTML and CSS?

Q10: How do I make a good first impression in a job interview?

Q11: I'm learning to code and interested in Python. What's a good first project for a beginner?

Q12: Tell me a short joke, then explain why it's funny.

**COMPLEX & TECHNICAL:**

Q13: Explain quantum entanglement and its implications for quantum computing in detail.

Q14: Design a complete database schema for a social media platform with users, posts, comments, likes, and followers. Include all tables, foreign keys, indexes, and explain the relationships.

Q15: Write a Python function that implements the quicksort algorithm with detailed comments explaining each step and the time complexity.

Q16: What are the philosophical implications of artificial consciousness? Explore multiple perspectives including functionalism, emergentism, and the Chinese Room argument.

Q17: Explain the backpropagation algorithm in neural networks. Include mathematical notation showing how gradients are calculated and propagated backward through the network.

Q18: Explain Einstein's theory of relativity and how it fundamentally changed our understanding of space-time. Include both special and general relativity.

Q19: Explain how CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing works at the molecular level and discuss the ethical implications of human germline editing.

Q20: Describe the architectural differences between microservices and monolithic applications, including deployment strategies, scalability patterns, and when to use each approach.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR TESTER:
================================================================================

1. Create a NEW conversation
2. Select "🤖 Auto (AI picks best model)" from dropdown
3. Copy the ENTIRE message above and paste it
4. While it's responding, watch the backend logs

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Auto mode will select ONE model for the entire message (likely gpt-4o since the overall message is complex)
- The AI should answer all 20 questions
- Responses to simple questions (Q1-Q7) should be brief
- Responses to moderate questions (Q8-Q12) should be moderately detailed
- Responses to complex questions (Q13-Q20) should be very detailed and comprehensive

WHAT TO CHECK IN BACKEND LOGS:
Look for: "🤖 Auto-selected model: [model name] for query: 'Please answer ALL...'"

Expected model selection:
- If it picks gpt-4o or gpt-4-turbo: CORRECT (the overall message is complex)
- If it picks gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4o-mini: WRONG (should use capable model for this)

SUCCESS = AI answers all 20 questions thoroughly
FAILURE = Short response, skipped questions, or errors
