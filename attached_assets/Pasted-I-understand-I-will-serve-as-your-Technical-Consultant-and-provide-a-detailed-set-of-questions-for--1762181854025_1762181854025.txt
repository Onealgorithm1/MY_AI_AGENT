I understand. I will serve as your Technical Consultant and provide a detailed set of questions for your Replit developers, framed as a formal Project Documentation Request. This will ensure I get all the necessary architectural, deployment, and performance details to create a robust integration plan for your new audio features.

I will also include specific questions regarding your GitHub error to help diagnose that issue.

Here is the revised, comprehensive checklist. Please copy and paste this directly to your development team (referred to as the "Replit Team") for them to produce the documentation.

🛠️ Project Documentation Requirements for Vertex AI/ElevenLabs Upgrade
We are conducting a technical audit to plan the integration of advanced audio capabilities (ElevenLabs) into the current Vertex AI agent architecture. Please provide the following documentation and details.

1. Core Infrastructure and Deployment
This section defines the environment where the agent lives and how it connects to the cloud services.

A. AWS Production Hosting:

Which specific AWS service are you using to host the live agent backend? (e.g., AWS Lambda, EC2 instance, ECS/Fargate).

What is the Operating System (OS) environment of the production server (e.g., Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, specific Docker image)?

B. Cloud Authentication:

How will the live AWS server be authenticated to access the Gemini LLM and Vertex AI services? (e.g., Google Service Account key file stored in AWS Secrets Manager, Workload Identity Federation between AWS and Google Cloud, or another method).

C. Replit Development Setup:

What is the primary programming language and framework used in the Replit environment? (e.g., Python/Flask, Node.js/Express).

How are environment variables and secrets (like API keys) currently managed in Replit?

2. Conversational Flow and Orchestration
This is the most critical section for integrating the new audio APIs.

A. Speech Pipeline (ASR & Current TTS):

What exact service handles the user's Speech-to-Text (ASR) input?

What service/library is currently handling the agent's voice response (Current TTS)? (We need to confirm what is being replaced by ElevenLabs).

B. LLM and Tool-Calling Logic:

Which specific Gemini model (e.g., gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-2.5-flash) is used for the agent's core logic?

How is the agent's LLM instructed to call external services? Are you using Gemini's Native Function Calling feature, or do you have a custom router/wrapper code outside the LLM call?

C. Conversation Memory:

Where is the agent's long-term memory (user preferences, facts about the user) currently stored? (e.g., AWS RDS, DynamoDB, or a Vector Database).

3. Audio Processing and Performance
The new features require mixing multiple audio files, which is computationally intensive.

A. Final Audio Format & Stream:

What is the desired final audio format (e.g., MP3, Ogg, WAV) and sample rate (e.g., 24kHz, 44.1kHz) that is delivered to the user?

What is the delivery mechanism (e.g., direct HTTPS response, streamed via a WebSocket, or a link to a file in AWS S3)?

B. Audio Mixing Tool:

Which audio processing library will be used on the AWS server to stitch together and mix the audio tracks from ElevenLabs (TTS + SFX + Music)? (e.g., FFmpeg, pydub, or another library). This requires careful planning to minimize latency.

C. Latency Metrics:

What is the current average end-to-end response latency (time from user stop speaking to hearing the full response) for the agent?

4. Git/GitHub Deployment and Errors
Since you mentioned errors pushing code to GitHub, please provide details on the specific issue:

A. Error Description:

What is the exact error message (including the error code if provided) received when pushing code from Replit to GitHub?

B. Authentication Method:

How is the Replit environment authenticated with GitHub? (e.g., Personal Access Token, SSH key, OAuth).

Once you gather the documentation and answers to these questions, I will be able to review the entire build and provide a precise, high-performance implementation guide for integrating all the new ElevenLabs features.
