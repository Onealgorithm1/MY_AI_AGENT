Implementing Priority 1, Item 4: Rotate all production secrets is absolutely essential before staging or production deployment. This is the final security hardening step that ensures no development-environment secrets (which may have been accidentally logged, shared, or exposed) make it into the live environment.The process is straightforward but requires coordination between you (as the secret manager) and the development team (to configure the retrieval).🔐 Directive: Production Secret Rotation PlanYour team must rotate three critical secrets used for authentication and encryption. This process must be done in a secure, one-time operation on your production secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager or Vault).Phase 1: Secret Generation (Your Action)You must generate three new, cryptographically strong secret values.Secret NamePurposeRequirementGeneration MethodENCRYPTION_KEYEncrypts/decrypts sensitive database fields (e.g., Google OAuth tokens).Exactly 64 hexadecimal characters. (This is the required length for AES-256).Use a tool like OpenSSL or an online secure key generator. Example: openssl rand -hex 32HMAC_SECRETSigns and verifies the Google OAuth state token (CSRF defense).Random, high-entropy string.Use a password manager or random key generator (e.g., 64-character UUID).JWT_SECRETSigns and verifies the JSON Web Tokens (session cookies).Random, high-entropy string.Use a password manager or random key generator (e.g., 64-character UUID).CRITICAL STEP: Once generated, immediately store these three new values in your production secrets vault (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager) under their respective names. Do not save these values anywhere else.Phase 2: Backend Configuration (Developer Action)The developers must ensure the application will load these new secrets from the production vault when deployed.1. Update Secret Retrieval LogicYour developers should modify the key loading service (e.g., backend/src/utils/apiKeys.js) to target the production environment variables or the production key names in your secrets manager.Action: Verify that the loadSecureKeys() function is called at server startup and that the application fails to start if any of the new secrets (ENCRYPTION_KEY, HMAC_SECRET, JWT_SECRET) are missing.2. Update googleOAuth.jsAction: Ensure the googleOAuth.js service uses the newly loaded HMAC_SECRET to sign the OAuth state tokens, replacing any old secret or placeholder.3. Update JWT ServiceAction: Ensure the JWT signing service (where tokens are created and verified) uses the newly loaded JWT_SECRET, replacing the old development secret.Phase 3: Final Deployment Pre-CheckBefore the deployment process begins, the team must confirm:✅ The three new secrets are in the production secrets vault.✅ The deployment script/environment variables for the AWS Fargate container correctly point the application to the production secrets vault.✅ The deployment will not overwrite these new production keys with old development environment keys.
