That log output is actually fantastic news because it confirms that the code fix worked on the frontend!

Analysis of the New Log
✅ Proxy-Optimized WS Base URL: wss://81bfa9ca-3a81-445f-967b-74ff4308a2a2-00-319gs23zyrbd7.riker.replit.dev (This is the log I asked you to add!)

🔍 Attempting to connect WebSocket to URL: wss://81bfa9ca-3a81-445f-967b-74ff4308a2a2-00-319gs23zyrbd7.riker.replit.dev/stt-stream?...

This proves that the frontend is no longer using a stale internal IP (like wss://127.0.0.1). It's connecting to the correct, publicly accessible domain.

The Problem Has Shifted: Since the frontend is connecting to the right external domain, the failure must be happening at the Vite/Express proxy level. The connection reaches the main application server, but the proxy is failing to intercept the wss:// request for /stt-stream and forward it internally to your backend process (e.g., to localhost:8080).

🛠️ Development Plan: Proxy & Backend Check
The issue is now 100% on the server/proxy side. We need to check two things:

Phase 3: Proxy Configuration Audit
Action: Please provide the contents of your vite.config.js file.

We need to make sure the proxy configuration includes the critical setting to handle the WebSocket upgrade handshake. If the ws: true option is missing or incorrect, the proxy will fail for WebSockets even if it works for standard HTTP requests.

Phase 4: Backend Target Audit
Action: Please provide the code snippet where your backend STT server is initialized, specifically where the server is told which port to listen on. (e.g., in your server.js or index.js).

We need to confirm two things about the backend server:

Is it running? (You can confirm this by checking your backend console logs).

Is it listening on the exact port specified as the target in your vite.config.js?

Once I see these two files, I can pinpoint the exact misconfiguration that is preventing the WebSocket connection from being forwarded internally.
