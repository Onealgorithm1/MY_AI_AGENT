Here’s a step-by-step guide your dev team can follow to integrate the OpenAI Administration / Admin API (sometimes called “GPT Admin API”) into your platform — from setup through implementation, with permissions, security, and workflows. This covers the special admin-endpoints (not just the model usage API). The relevant docs are available.

🔍 Overview: What is the Admin API

The Admin/API Keys endpoints let your organization programmatically manage your OpenAI Org: users, billing, API keys, audits.

Use-cases: create/revoke API keys, view usage logs, enforce governance, audit access.

Important: these endpoints carry elevated privileges — treat them as admin tools.

✅ Step-by-Step Implementation
Step 1: Ensure Org & Access Permissions

Ensure your OpenAI Organization has the right plan (Enterprise or whichever supports Admin APIs).

Make sure your user account is an Organization Owner or has “Admin/API Keys” privileges.

In the OpenAI dashboard go to Settings → Organization → Roles & permissions to assign.

Important: Admin API keys are distinct from “normal usage” API keys.

Step 2: Generate an Admin API Key

In the OpenAI dashboard go to API Keys section.

Choose to create a new key and specify this is for Admin usage (if prompted).

Store the secret securely (you will not be able to retrieve it later).

Immediately record which key is for what (e.g., “Admin-Key for Governance Bot – revocable”).

Step 3: Setup Your Backend/SDK to Use the Admin API

In your server/backend environment:

Store the admin key in a secure secrets store (environment variable, vault).

Use the base URL: https://api.openai.com/v1/ and appropriate endpoint path (for admin services) as per docs.

Example pseudocode (Node.js/Express):

const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const ADMIN_KEY = process.env.OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY;

async function listApiKeys() {
  const resp = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/admin/api_keys', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${ADMIN_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  });
  const data = await resp.json();
  return data;
}

// Call it
listApiKeys().then(keys => console.log(keys)).catch(err => console.error(err));


Adjust for whichever endpoint you need (create key, revoke key, list users, etc). Refer to docs.

Step 4: Define Admin Workflows & Endpoints You’ll Use

Key management: Create new API keys for projects/users; revoke old ones.

User/account management: Add/remove users, assign roles, maybe via SCIM if applicable.

Usage & audit logs: Retrieve logs of API usage, key usage, revoke misuse.

Budgeting / limits: Use API keys and logs to enforce spend limits, alert on anomalies.

Map each of these into your internal backend services (e.g., “/admin/createKey”, “/admin/revokeKey”, etc).

Step 5: Security & Access Control

Only allow a small set of services or users to call admin endpoints.

Log every call to admin API (who triggered it, when, why).

Use strong authentication (e.g., MFA) for any UI/CLI that triggers admin flows.

Rotate admin keys regularly. If a key is compromised, revoke immediately. 
docs.gitguardian.com

Use IP allow-lists where possible.

Monitor for unusual patterns (mass key creation, frequent revocations).

Step 6: Handle Errors, Rate Limits, and Workflow Safeguards

Expect rate limits on Admin API calls; implement retry/backoff logic.

Build protective UX: e.g., “Are you sure?” confirmation before revoking keys in production.

Build a change-log + rollback strategy (if a key is revoked inadvertently).

Alert on key usage spikes, keys used outside expected scopes.

Step 7: Testing, Review, and Rollout

In staging environment: create a test admin key, run workflows (create user, list keys, revoke key).

Review logs to ensure correct attribution.

Conduct security audit on only admin endpoints being reachable by necessary apps.

Rollout to production with feature flag or limited users first.

Train operators/dev-ops on how to use admin UI/API safely.

🧠 Summary for Your Dev Team

Ensure org permissions and plan support “Admin/API Keys” endpoints.

Create and securely store an Admin API Key.

Build backend connector to call Admin endpoints, wrapped in secure services.

Define and implement workflows: key management, user roles, audit logs, usage monitoring.

Add security controls: limited access, logging, rotation, monitoring.

Test in staging, then rollout gradually.

Maintain documentation + write operations guides for revoking/rotating keys.
