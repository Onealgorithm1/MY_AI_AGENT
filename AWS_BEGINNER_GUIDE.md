# üöÄ AWS Server Setup for Complete Beginners

**Don't worry - this guide assumes you know NOTHING about servers!**

We'll set up your AI chat application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) step by step.

---

## What You'll Need

- ‚úÖ AWS Account (you have this)
- ‚úÖ Credit/Debit card (AWS requires one, even for free tier)
- ‚úÖ Your OpenAI API key
- ‚è±Ô∏è About 1 hour of time

---

## Part 1: Understanding What We're Doing

Think of this like setting up a computer in the cloud:

1. **Database (RDS)** = A filing cabinet that stores all your data
2. **Server (EC2)** = A computer that runs your application 24/7
3. **Your App** = The AI chat software we'll install on that computer

Let's start!

---

## Part 2: Create Your Database (The Easy Way)

### Step 1: Log into AWS

1. Go to: https://aws.amazon.com
2. Click **"Sign In to the Console"** (top right)
3. Enter your email and password
4. You should see the AWS Management Console (looks like a dashboard)

### Step 2: Open RDS (Database Service)

1. At the top, you'll see a search bar that says **"Search for services, features..."**
2. Type: **RDS**
3. Click on **"RDS"** (it says "Managed Relational Database Service")

### Step 3: Create Database

1. You'll see a page with "Amazon RDS" at the top
2. Look for an orange button that says **"Create database"**
3. Click it

### Step 4: Choose Database Type

Now you'll see a form with lots of options. Follow exactly:

**Engine options:**
- Click on **"PostgreSQL"** (it's a circle/radio button)

**Version:**
- Leave as default (should be PostgreSQL 14.something or 15.something)

**Templates:**
- Click **"Free tier"** (this saves money while testing!)

### Step 5: Settings Section

Scroll down to the **"Settings"** section:

**DB instance identifier:**
- Type: `myaiagent-db`
- (This is just the name of your database)

**Master username:**
- Leave as: `postgres`
- (This is the admin username)

**Master password:**
- Click **"Auto generate a password"** OR
- Click **"Self managed"** and create a password
- **IMPORTANT:** Write down this password! You'll need it later.
- Example password: `MyAIAgent2024!`

### Step 6: Instance Configuration

Scroll down to **"Instance configuration"**:

- Should already show **"db.t3.micro"** (this is free tier)
- Leave it as is

**Storage:**
- Leave everything as default (20 GiB is fine)

### Step 7: Connectivity (IMPORTANT!)

Scroll to **"Connectivity"**:

**Public access:**
- Click **"Yes"**
- (We need this so your server can talk to the database)

**VPC security group:**
- Click **"Create new"**
- New VPC security group name: `myaiagent-db-security`

### Step 8: Additional Configuration

Scroll down and click **"Additional configuration"** (it expands):

**Initial database name:**
- Type: `myaiagent`
- **Don't skip this!** If you don't see this field, make sure you expanded "Additional configuration"

**Backup:**
- Enable automatic backups: ‚úÖ (leave checked)
- Backup retention period: 7 days (default is fine)

**Encryption:**
- Leave enabled (it's for security)

### Step 9: Create It!

1. Scroll all the way to the bottom
2. You'll see an orange button: **"Create database"**
3. Click it
4. You'll see a success message
5. If you chose auto-generate password, click **"View credential details"** and SAVE the password

**Wait 5-10 minutes** while AWS creates your database. You'll see a status that says "Creating..."

### Step 10: Get Database Connection Info

1. Stay on the RDS page
2. Click **"Databases"** in the left sidebar
3. Wait until the status says **"Available"** (refresh the page)
4. Click on **"myaiagent-db"** (the name you created)
5. Scroll to **"Connectivity & security"** section
6. Find **"Endpoint"** - it looks like: `myaiagent-db.abc123.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
7. **COPY THIS and save it in a notepad!** You'll need it later.

### Step 11: Open Database to Accept Connections

1. On the same page, under **"Connectivity & security"**
2. Find **"VPC security groups"**
3. Click on the security group link (looks like `sg-0abc123...`)
4. This opens a new tab showing security rules
5. At the bottom, click the **"Inbound rules"** tab
6. Click **"Edit inbound rules"** button
7. Click **"Add rule"**
8. For **Type**, select **"PostgreSQL"** from dropdown
9. For **Source**, select **"Anywhere-IPv4"** from dropdown
   - (In production, you'd restrict this, but for now we keep it simple)
10. Click **"Save rules"** (orange button at bottom right)

**Done!** Your database is ready! ‚úÖ

---

## Part 3: Create Your Server (EC2)

Now let's create the computer that will run your app.

### Step 1: Go to EC2

1. At the top search bar, type: **EC2**
2. Click **"EC2"** (says "Virtual Servers in the Cloud")

### Step 2: Launch Instance

1. You'll see the EC2 Dashboard
2. Look for an orange button: **"Launch instance"**
3. Click it
4. You might see a dropdown - click **"Launch instance"** again

### Step 3: Name Your Server

**Name and tags:**
- Under **"Name"**, type: `MyAIAgent-Server`

### Step 4: Choose Operating System

**Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image):**

1. You'll see several options (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows...)
2. Click on **"Ubuntu"**
3. Make sure it says **"Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS"**
4. Should say **"Free tier eligible"** - perfect!

### Step 5: Choose Server Size

**Instance type:**

1. You'll see **"t2.micro"** with a **"Free tier eligible"** tag
2. **BUT** - for this app, we need more power
3. Click the dropdown and select **"t3.small"** (2GB RAM)
   - Note: This costs about $15/month, NOT free tier
   - If you want to try free tier first, use t2.micro, but app might be slow

### Step 6: Create Security Key (IMPORTANT!)

**Key pair (login):**

This is like a key to your server - you MUST have this to access it!

1. Click **"Create new key pair"**
2. A popup appears:
   - **Key pair name:** `myaiagent-key`
   - **Key pair type:** RSA (leave as is)
   - **Private key file format:**
     - If you use Mac/Linux: Choose **.pem**
     - If you use Windows: Choose **.pem** (you can convert later if needed)
3. Click **"Create key pair"**
4. A file downloads: `myaiagent-key.pem`
5. **SAVE THIS FILE!** Put it somewhere safe. If you lose it, you can't access your server!

### Step 7: Network Settings (IMPORTANT!)

**Network settings:**

1. Click **"Edit"** on the right side
2. You'll see a form

**Firewall (security groups):**
- Click **"Create security group"**
- Security group name: `myaiagent-server-sg`
- Description: `Security for AI Agent server`

**Inbound Security Group Rules:**

You'll see one rule already (SSH). We need to add more.

Click **"Add security group rule"** for EACH of these:

**Rule 1** (already there):
- Type: SSH
- Source type: Anywhere (or "My IP" for better security)

**Rule 2:**
- Click "Add security group rule"
- Type: Select **"HTTP"** from dropdown
- Source type: **"Anywhere"**

**Rule 3:**
- Click "Add security group rule"
- Type: Select **"HTTPS"** from dropdown
- Source type: **"Anywhere"**

**Rule 4:**
- Click "Add security group rule"
- Type: Select **"Custom TCP"**
- Port range: `3000`
- Source type: **"Anywhere"**
- Description: "Backend API"

**Rule 5:**
- Click "Add security group rule"
- Type: Select **"Custom TCP"**
- Port range: `5173`
- Source type: **"Anywhere"**
- Description: "Frontend"

### Step 8: Storage

**Configure storage:**
- Should show **"8 GiB gp3"** by default
- Change **8** to **20** (we need more space)
- Leave everything else as is

### Step 9: Review

**Summary** panel on the right shows:
- Instance type: t3.small
- Number of instances: 1
- Software Image: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Looks good!

### Step 10: Launch It!

1. On the right side, click the orange button: **"Launch instance"**
2. You'll see "Successfully initiated launch of instance"
3. Click **"View all instances"**

### Step 11: Wait for Server to Start

1. You'll see your instance with a **"Status check"** column
2. Wait until it says **"2/2 checks passed"** (takes 2-3 minutes)
3. **Instance state** should be **"Running"** (green dot)

### Step 12: Get Your Server Address

1. Click on your instance (click the checkbox or the instance ID)
2. Look at the **"Details"** tab below
3. Find and COPY these (save in notepad):
   - **Public IPv4 address** (looks like: `54.123.45.67`)
   - **Public IPv4 DNS** (looks like: `ec2-54-123-45-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com`)

**Done!** Your server is running! ‚úÖ

## Part 4: Connect to Your Server

Now we need to log into your server using your computer.

### For Mac Users:

1. Open **Terminal** (Applications ‚Üí Utilities ‚Üí Terminal)
2. Move your key file to a safe location:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/.ssh
   mv ~/Downloads/myaiagent-key.pem ~/.ssh/
   chmod 400 ~/.ssh/myaiagent-key.pem
   ```
3. Connect to your server (replace `54.123.45.67` with YOUR server's IP):
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/myaiagent-key.pem ubuntu@54.123.45.67
   ```
4. Type `yes` when asked "Are you sure you want to continue connecting?"
5. You should now see a prompt like `ubuntu@ip-172-31-45-67:~$`

**You're in!** üéâ

### For Windows Users:

**Option 1: Use Windows Terminal (Windows 10/11)**

1. Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**
2. Navigate to where you saved the key:
   ```cmd
   cd Downloads
   ```
3. Connect (replace `54.123.45.67` with YOUR server's IP):
   ```bash
   ssh -i myaiagent-key.pem ubuntu@54.123.45.67
   ```
4. If you get a permission error, you may need to use PuTTY (Option 2)

**Option 2: Use PuTTY**

1. Download PuTTY: https://www.putty.org/
2. Download PuTTYgen (comes with PuTTY)
3. Open **PuTTYgen**
4. Click **"Load"** and select your `myaiagent-key.pem` file
5. Click **"Save private key"** ‚Üí Save as `myaiagent-key.ppk`
6. Open **PuTTY**

## Part 5: Install Everything Needed

Now type these commands ONE BY ONE in your server terminal.

### Step 1: Update the Server

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
*This updates all the software. Takes 2-3 minutes. Press Enter if asked anything.*

### Step 2: Install Node.js (JavaScript runtime)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```
*Wait for it to finish (1-2 minutes)*

Check if it worked:
```bash
node --version
```
*Should show something like `v20.11.0`*

### Step 3: Install PostgreSQL Client (to talk to database)

```bash
sudo apt install -y postgresql-client
```

### Step 4: Install PM2 (keeps your app running)

```bash
sudo npm install -g pm2
```

### Step 5: Install Git (to download your code)

```bash
sudo apt install -y git
```

### Step 6: Install Nginx (web server)

```bash
sudo apt install -y nginx
```

**All software installed!** ‚úÖ

---

## Part 6: Download and Setup Your Application

### Step 1: Clone Your Code

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu
git clone https://github.com/Onealgorithm1/MY_AI_AGENT.git
cd MY_AI_AGENT/myaiagent-mvp
```

*If it asks for username/password, you may need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token*

### Step 2: Generate Security Keys

Run this command and SAVE the output:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Copy the output - this is your **JWT_SECRET**

Run it again:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Copy this output - this is your **ENCRYPTION_KEY**

### Step 3: Create Backend Configuration

```bash
cd backend
nano .env
```

*This opens a text editor. Type or paste this (replace the values in CAPS):*

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000

# Replace with your RDS endpoint from Part 2, Step 10
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:YOUR_DB_PASSWORD@YOUR_RDS_ENDPOINT:5432/myaiagent

# Replace with your OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_OPENAI_KEY

# Replace with the keys you generated above
JWT_SECRET=your_generated_jwt_secret_here
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_generated_encryption_key_here

# Replace YOUR_EC2_IP with your server IP from Part 3, Step 12
CORS_ORIGINS=http://YOUR_EC2_IP:5173,http://YOUR_EC2_IP

RATE_LIMIT_MESSAGES=100
RATE_LIMIT_VOICE_MINUTES=30
VOICE_SESSION_MAX_MINUTES=10
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=20
```

**Example of what it should look like:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:MyAIAgent2024!@myaiagent-db.abc123.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/myaiagent
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-abc123xyz789...
JWT_SECRET=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
ENCRYPTION_KEY=z9y8x7w6v5u4t3s2r1q0p9o8n7m6l5k4
CORS_ORIGINS=http://54.123.45.67:5173,http://54.123.45.67
```

**Save and exit:**
- Press `Ctrl + X`
- Press `Y` (yes to save)
- Press `Enter`

### Step 4: Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

*This takes 2-3 minutes. You'll see lots of text scrolling.*

### Step 5: Setup Database Tables

```bash
npm run setup-db
```

*This creates all the tables in your database. Should see "Database setup complete!"*

### Step 6: Start Backend Server

```bash
pm2 start src/server.js --name myaiagent-api
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

*After the last command, it will show you another command to copy and run. Copy it and run it.*

Test if it's working:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

*Should show: `{"status":"ok"}`*

### Step 7: Setup Frontend

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/MY_AI_AGENT/myaiagent-mvp/frontend
nano .env
```

*Type this (replace YOUR_EC2_IP with your server IP):*

```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://YOUR_EC2_IP:3000/api
VITE_WS_URL=ws://YOUR_EC2_IP:3000/voice
VITE_DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-4o
```

**Example:**
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://54.123.45.67:3000/api
VITE_WS_URL=ws://54.123.45.67:3000/voice
VITE_DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-4o
```

**Save:** `Ctrl + X`, `Y`, `Enter`

### Step 8: Build and Start Frontend

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

*This takes 3-5 minutes. Builds your website.*

```bash
sudo npm install -g serve
pm2 start --name myaiagent-web "serve -s dist -l 5173"
pm2 save
```

## Part 7: Open Your Application!

### Test It!

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
2. Go to: `http://YOUR_EC2_IP:5173` (replace with your IP)
   - Example: `http://54.123.45.67:5173`

3. You should see the login page!

**Default Login:**
- Email: `admin@myaiagent.com`
- Password: `admin123`

**IT WORKS!** üéâüéâüéâ

---

## Part 8: Change the Admin Password (IMPORTANT!)

1. After logging in, go to your profile settings
2. Change the password from `admin123` to something secure

**OR** change it via terminal:

```bash
# Connect to your server if not already connected
# Then run:
psql "postgresql://postgres:YOUR_DB_PASSWORD@YOUR_RDS_ENDPOINT:5432/myaiagent"

# In the database prompt, type:
UPDATE users
SET password_hash = crypt('YourNewPassword123!', gen_salt('bf'))
WHERE email = 'admin@myaiagent.com';

# Exit database:
\q
```
