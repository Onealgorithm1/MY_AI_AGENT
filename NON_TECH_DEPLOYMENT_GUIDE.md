# üéØ Auto-Deployment for Non-Tech Users
### Make Your Code Go Live Automatically - No Coding Skills Needed!

This guide will help you set up **automatic deployment**. This means: every time you save your code to GitHub, it will automatically appear on your live website at **3.144.201.118:5173**

**Time needed:** 15-20 minutes
**Skills needed:** None! Just follow each step exactly.

---

## üì± What You'll Need

Before starting, have these ready:
- ‚úÖ Your GitHub account login
- ‚úÖ Access to your server at 3.144.201.118 (the login username and password)
- ‚úÖ 15 minutes of uninterrupted time

---

# PART 1: Set Up GitHub Secrets (5 minutes)

## What are GitHub Secrets?
Think of them like passwords that GitHub uses to connect to your server automatically. You only set them up once.

---

### Step 1: Go to GitHub Settings

1. **Open your web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

2. **Type this exact URL** in the address bar:
   ```
   https://github.com/Onealgorithm1/MY_AI_AGENT
   ```

3. **Press Enter**

4. You should see your project page. Look at the top menu.

5. **Click on "Settings"** (it's on the right side of the menu)
   - If you don't see Settings, you might not be logged in. Log in first.

---

### Step 2: Find the Secrets Page

1. On the **left sidebar**, scroll down until you see **"Secrets and variables"**

2. **Click on "Secrets and variables"** to expand it

3. **Click on "Actions"** underneath it

4. You should now see a page that says **"Actions secrets and variables"** at the top

5. Look for a green button that says **"New repository secret"**

---

### Step 3: Add Secret #1 - SERVER_HOST

1. **Click the green "New repository secret" button**

2. You'll see two boxes:
   - **Name** (top box)
   - **Secret** (big box below)

3. In the **Name** box, type exactly:
   ```
   SERVER_HOST
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Type it EXACTLY like that - all capital letters, with underscore

4. In the **Secret** box, type your server's address:
   ```
   3.144.201.118
   ```

5. **Click the green "Add secret" button** at the bottom

6. You should see a green success message

---

### Step 4: Add Secret #2 - SERVER_USER

1. **Click "New repository secret"** again (the green button)

2. In the **Name** box, type exactly:
   ```
   SERVER_USER
   ```

3. In the **Secret** box, type your server username
   - Common usernames are: `ubuntu`, `ec2-user`, `root`, or `admin`
   - **Don't know your username?** Check the email when you set up your server, or ask whoever set it up

4. **Click "Add secret"**

---

### Step 5: Add Secret #3 - SSH_PRIVATE_KEY (This one is tricky!)

#### What is an SSH Key?
It's like a special password file on your computer that lets GitHub connect to your server securely.

#### Finding Your SSH Key:

**If you're on Mac or Linux:**

1. **Open Terminal**
   - Mac: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter
   - Linux: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

2. **Type this command** and press Enter:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

3. You'll see a bunch of text that looks like this:
   ```
   -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
   MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEA... (lots of random letters and numbers)
   -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
   ```

4. **Select ALL of this text** (from -----BEGIN to -----END)
   - Mac: Press `Cmd + A` to select all
   - Linux: Click and drag to select all

5. **Copy it**
   - Mac: Press `Cmd + C`
   - Linux: Press `Ctrl + Shift + C`

**If you're on Windows:**

1. **Open Command Prompt**
   - Press `Windows Key + R`
   - Type `cmd` and press Enter

2. **Type this command** and press Enter:
   ```
   type %USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_rsa
   ```

3. **Select all the text** that appears (from -----BEGIN to -----END)

4. **Right-click** and choose **Copy**

---

#### Adding the SSH Key to GitHub:

1. Go back to your **GitHub browser tab**

2. **Click "New repository secret"** again

3. In the **Name** box, type exactly:
   ```
   SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
   ```

4. In the **Secret** box:
   - **Right-click** and choose **Paste**
   - OR press `Ctrl + V` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + V` (Mac)

5. Make sure you see:
   - `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` at the top
   - `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` at the bottom
   - Lots of random text in between

6. **Click "Add secret"**

---

### Step 6: Add Secret #4 - SSH_PORT (Optional but recommended)

1. **Click "New repository secret"** one more time

2. In the **Name** box, type exactly:
   ```
   SSH_PORT
   ```

3. In the **Secret** box, type:
   ```
   22
   ```
   (This is the standard port number for SSH)

4. **Click "Add secret"**

---

### ‚úÖ Check Your Secrets

You should now see **4 secrets** listed:
- ‚úÖ SERVER_HOST
- ‚úÖ SERVER_USER
- ‚úÖ SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
- ‚úÖ SSH_PORT

**Great job!** Part 1 is done! Take a 2-minute break if you need it.

---

# PART 2: Set Up Your Server (10 minutes)

## What We're Doing:
We need to prepare your server (the computer at 3.144.201.118) to receive automatic updates.

   ```bash
   ssh ubuntu@3.144.201.118
   ```

3. **Press Enter**

4. If you see a message like "Are you sure you want to continue connecting?", type:
   ```
   yes
   ```
   Then press Enter

5. **Enter your password** when asked
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** You won't see the password as you type. That's normal! Just type it and press Enter

6. You're connected when you see something like:
   ```
   ubuntu@ip-172-31-45-67:~$
   ```

#### On Windows:

1. **Download PuTTY** if you don't have it:
   - Go to: https://www.putty.org/
   - Click "Download PuTTY"
   - Install it

2. **Open PuTTY**

3. In the **"Host Name"** box, type:
   ```
   3.144.201.118

4. Make sure **Port** is set to `22`

5. **Click "Open"**

6. If you see a security alert, click **"Yes"**

7. **Type your username** (like `ubuntu`) and press Enter

8. **Type your password** and press Enter
   - You won't see it as you type - that's normal!

9. You're connected when you see something like:
   ```
   ubuntu@ip-172-31-45-67:~$
   ```

---

### Step 2: Navigate to Home Directory

You should be connected to your server now. Let's make sure we're in the right place.

1. **Type this command** and press Enter:
   ```bash
   cd ~
   ```
   This takes you to your "home" folder.

2. **Type this command** and press Enter:
   ```bash

   ```
   You should see something like `/home/ubuntu`

---

### Step 3: Check if Project Exists

Let's see if the project is already on your server.

1. **Type this command** and press Enter:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   This shows all folders in your current location.

2. **Look for "MY_AI_AGENT"** in the list

**If you see MY_AI_AGENT:**
- Skip to **Step 5** below

**If you DON'T see MY_AI_AGENT:**
- Continue to **Step 4** below

---

### Step 4: Download the Project (If Needed)

Only do this if you DIDN'T see MY_AI_AGENT in the previous step.

1. **Type this command** and press Enter:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Onealgorithm1/MY_AI_AGENT.git
   ```

2. Wait for it to finish. You'll see text scrolling. When it stops and you see the `$` again, it's done.

3. **Type this to verify** it worked:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   You should now see **MY_AI_AGENT** in the list.

---

### Step 5: Go Into the Project Folder

1. **Type this command** and press Enter:
   ```bash
   cd MY_AI_AGENT
   ```

2. **Type this to confirm** you're in the right place:

   pwd
   ```
   You should see: `/home/ubuntu/MY_AI_AGENT` (or similar)

---

### Step 6: Get Latest Code

1. **Type this command** and press Enter:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Then type this** and press Enter:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. Wait for it to finish. You might see text like "Already up to date" or files being downloaded.

---

### Step 7: Install PM2 (Process Manager)

**What is PM2?** It's a tool that keeps your website running even if something crashes.

1. **Type this command** and press Enter:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   ```

2. Wait for it to install. You'll see progress bars and text scrolling. This might take 1-2 minutes.

3. When you see the `$` again, it's done.

4. **Type this command** and press Enter:
   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   ```

5. Wait again for it to finish.

---

### Step 8: Make the Deployment Script Executable
