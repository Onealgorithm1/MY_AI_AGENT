COMPREHENSIVE AUTO MODE TEST - SINGLE MESSAGE
================================================================================

Copy the entire message below and paste it into the chat with Auto mode selected.
The AI should respond to each question and EXPLICITLY state which model it's 
using for each response.

PASTE THIS ENTIRE MESSAGE INTO THE CHAT:

---

I'm testing your Auto mode intelligent model selection. For EACH question below, please:
1. State which model you're using (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4-turbo, or gpt-3.5-turbo)
2. Provide your answer
3. Briefly explain WHY you chose that model for this specific question

Here are the test questions covering different complexity levels:

**SIMPLE GREETINGS & FACTS:**

1. Hello! How are you?

2. What is 2 + 2?

3. Who was the first president of the United States?

4. What are the primary colors?

**MODERATE COMPLEXITY:**

5. Can you explain how photosynthesis works?

6. What's the difference between HTML and CSS?

7. How do I make a good first impression in a job interview?

**COMPLEX REASONING:**

8. Explain quantum entanglement and its implications for quantum computing.

9. What are the philosophical implications of artificial consciousness? Consider multiple perspectives.

10. Design a complete database schema for a social media platform with users, posts, comments, likes, followers, and direct messages. Include all relationships, foreign keys, and indexes.

**TECHNICAL/CODING:**

11. Write a Python function that implements a binary search algorithm with error handling.

12. Explain the difference between async/await and Promises in JavaScript, with practical examples.

**MULTI-TURN CONTEXT:**

13. I'm learning to code and interested in Python. What's a good first project for a beginner?

14. For that project, can you help me understand how loops work in Python?

**CREATIVE:**

15. Tell me a short joke.

16. Write a haiku about artificial intelligence.

**EDGE CASES:**

17. Tell me about models. (This is intentionally ambiguous - don't assume I mean AI models)

18. What's the fastest way to learn?

**RAPID-FIRE SIMPLE:**

19. What's 10 x 5?

20. Capital of France?

21. Spell 'necessary'

22. What year is it?

**MIXED COMPLEXITY:**

23. What is machine learning? (Simple explanation)

24. Explain the backpropagation algorithm in neural networks with mathematical formulas. (Complex)

25. Thanks! What's 5+5? (Simple)

For each response, use this format:

**Question [#]: [Repeat the question]**
**Model Used:** [gpt-4o / gpt-4o-mini / gpt-4-turbo / gpt-3.5-turbo]
**Why This Model:** [1-2 sentence explanation]
**Answer:** [Your response]

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
================================================================================

✅ GOOD RESPONSES:
- Questions 1-4, 15-16, 19-22, 23, 25: Should use gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4o-mini
- Questions 5-7, 13-14, 18: Should use gpt-4o-mini or gpt-4-turbo
- Questions 8-12, 24: Should use gpt-4o or gpt-4-turbo
- Question 17: Should ask for clarification or explain different types of models
- Each response clearly states the model being used
- Explanations make sense for why that model was chosen
- NO function calls should be triggered (no toast notifications)

❌ BAD RESPONSES:
- Uses same model for all questions
- Doesn't state which model is being used
- Model selection doesn't match question complexity
- Function calls triggered (toast notifications appear)
- Errors or refuses to answer

================================================================================

WHAT TO CHECK:
================================================================================

1. **Backend Logs:** Should show one auto-selected model (likely gpt-4o or gpt-4-turbo 
   since the full message is complex)

2. **Response Quality:** AI should internally understand different complexity levels
   and explain which model would be best for each question type

3. **No Function Calls:** This is a normal conversation, should NOT trigger any
   functions or show toast notifications

4. **Intelligence Test:** This tests if the AI understands its own model selection
   logic and can articulate it clearly

================================================================================

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
================================================================================

PASS ✅ if:
- AI responds to all 25 questions
- States model choice for each question
- Provides reasonable explanations for model selection
- Shows understanding that simple questions need cheaper models
- Shows understanding that complex questions need capable models
- NO function calls triggered
- Natural, helpful tone throughout

FAIL ❌ if:
- Claims to use same model for everything
- Doesn't state model choices
- Model selection logic is random or doesn't make sense
- Function calls triggered
- Errors or incomplete responses
