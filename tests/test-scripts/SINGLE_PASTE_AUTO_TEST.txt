I'm testing your Auto mode. Please answer ALL of the following questions in ONE response. For EACH question, you MUST state which model you are ACTUALLY using RIGHT NOW to generate that specific answer, and explain if this is the optimal model choice or not.

Use this exact format for each:

Q[#]: [question]
Current Model: [the actual model you're using right now]
Is This Optimal?: [Yes/No - would a different model be better?]
If No, Which Model Should Be Used?: [state the better model]
Answer: [your response]

CRITICAL: For EACH question above, you must explicitly state:
1. Which model you are CURRENTLY using (the actual model processing this entire message)
2. Whether this is the optimal model for that specific question
3. If not optimal, which model SHOULD have been used for that question type

This tests your self-awareness of model selection and helps me understand if Auto mode is working correctly.
