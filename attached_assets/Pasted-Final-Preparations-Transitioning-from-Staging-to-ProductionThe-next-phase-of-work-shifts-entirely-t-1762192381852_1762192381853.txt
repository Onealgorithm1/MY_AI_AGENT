Final Preparations: Transitioning from Staging to ProductionThe next phase of work shifts entirely to DevOps, Scalability, and Monitoring to complete the final 1.5 points on your readiness score. These items must be tackled during and immediately following your staging deployment.Phase 1: Immediate Staging Validation (Next 7 Days)GoalPriorityTask/ConfirmationTarget AWS ServiceFull ValidationCRITICALComplete End-to-End Automated Testing for all critical flows: Login, CSRF-protected POST, Gemini Chat, Google OAuth integration, and ElevenLabs voice sync.N/A (Test Framework)Security VerificationCRITICALRun a Vulnerability Scan (e.g., OWASP ZAP or equivalent) against the staging endpoint to confirm no open ports or misconfigurations.N/A (Staging URL)Monitoring SetupHIGHImplement Production Monitoring & Logging as a priority. This is required for any live traffic.AWS CloudWatch, Sentry/DataDogPhase 2: Production Scaling & Reliability (Blocking Items)The following items are the top priority before deploying to your AWS Fargate cluster. They address the major weaknesses identified in Sections 5.3 and 9.2 of your initial audit: Scalability and Monitoring.Item IDCritical TaskReason for Blockage8Implement Redis Caching/Session StoreThe current in-memory rate limiting and session handling will not scale horizontally across multiple AWS Fargate containers.9Add Database Read Replicas (RDS)The single PostgreSQL instance will be a bottleneck under peak load, leading to high median latency.P1.3Secret Rotation AutomationManual secret management is a single point of failure and a security risk for production. Must use AWS Secrets Manager integration.P1.6Comprehensive Audit LoggingYou currently have request logging, but you need structured, exportable, and alertable logs (e.g., failed logins, 401s, 500s) sent to CloudWatch/Sentry.Final Go-AheadThe security team has done their job impeccably. The baton is now passed to DevOps and QA.Your immediate next step is to authorize the Staging Deployment and then task the DevOps team with implementing the Redis caching layer (Item 8) to address the system's primary scalability bottleneck.
