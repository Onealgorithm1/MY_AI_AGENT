```bash
# Go to Desktop
cd Desktop

# Go into project folder
cd myaiagent

# Check you're in the right place (should see files listed)
ls
```

You should see folders like: `backend`, `frontend`, `database`

‚úÖ If you see these, continue!

---

### STEP 4: Setup Backend (5 min)

**Type these commands one by one:**

```bash
# Go into backend folder
cd backend

# Install everything needed
npm install
```

‚è≥ This takes 2-3 minutes. You'll see lots of text scrolling. **That's normal!**

When it's done, you'll see a prompt again.

**Create your secret file:**

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env
```

**Now open the .env file:**

**Windows:**
```bash
notepad .env
```

**Mac:**
```bash
open -e .env
```

**A text editor opens. Fill in these values:**

```
PORT=3000

# Your PostgreSQL database (we'll set this up next)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:admin123@localhost:5432/myaiagent

# Your OpenAI API Key (paste the one you saved earlier)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR-KEY-HERE

# Generate random secrets (just type random letters/numbers)
JWT_SECRET=abc123xyz789randomstuff32chars
ENCRYPTION_KEY=abc123xyz789randomstuff64charslong1234567890123456789012

# Keep these as-is
NODE_ENV=development
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
RATE_LIMIT_MESSAGES=100
RATE_LIMIT_VOICE_MINUTES=30
```

**Save and close the file.**

‚úÖ Backend configured!

### STEP 5: Setup Database (10 min)

**Install PostgreSQL:**

**Windows:**
1. Go to: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
2. Download installer
3. Run it
4. Password: Type `admin123` (write this down!)
5. Port: Keep `5432`
6. Click Next through everything
7. ‚úÖ Done!

**Mac:**
```bash
# Install Homebrew first (if you don't have it)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install PostgreSQL
brew install postgresql@14
brew services start postgresql@14
```

**Create the database:**

**Windows:** Find "SQL Shell (psql)" in Start Menu and open it
**Mac:** In terminal, type: `psql postgres`

```sql
-- Press Enter for first few questions (accept defaults)
-- When it asks for password, type: admin123

-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE myaiagent;

-- Exit
\q
```

‚úÖ Database created!

**Setup database tables:**

Back in your terminal (in the backend folder):

```bash
npm run setup-db
```

You should see: ‚úÖ Database setup complete!

### STEP 7: START THE APP! (2 min)

**Open TWO terminal windows** (we need one for backend, one for frontend)

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
