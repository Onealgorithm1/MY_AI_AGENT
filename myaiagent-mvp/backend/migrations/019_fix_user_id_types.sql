-- DEPRECATED MIGRATION: This migration was removed because it contained invalid SQL
-- It attempted to convert user_id from INTEGER to UUID using invalid syntax (user_id::UUID)
-- 
-- The correct approach is maintained in migration 021 which converts any remaining UUID
-- columns back to INTEGER to match users.id (SERIAL/INTEGER)
--
-- Initial schema (001) has been updated to use consistent INTEGER types for all user_id columns
-- This migration is kept as a placeholder for documentation purposes only
--
-- Migration 019 is NOW DISABLED and will be skipped by the migration runner
