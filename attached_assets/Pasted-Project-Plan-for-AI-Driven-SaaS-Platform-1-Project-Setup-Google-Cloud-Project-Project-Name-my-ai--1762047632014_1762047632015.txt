Make sure scopes are correctly set for each API:

Read/write, read-only, or admin as needed.

Include sensitive and restricted scopes if required.

Create service accounts for:

AI agent automation

Backend API calls

Create OAuth 2.0 Client IDs for web login and internal service calls.

2. Authentication & User Accounts
Google Sign-In

Use OAuth 2.0 for new users.

Flow:

User clicks “Sign in with Google”.

Redirect to Google consent screen (request required scopes).

Exchange authorization code for:

Access token (API calls)

Refresh token (long-term access)

ID token (user profile info)

Map user email to internal user ID in your database.

Native SaaS Sign-In

Implement traditional email/password login.

Store credentials securely (hashed + salted).

Allow users to link Google account to their existing internal account.

Account Linking & Management

Single internal user ID per person.

Handle:

Linking multiple login methods

Unlinking accounts

Permission updates

Store tokens securely (Secret Manager or database encrypted).

3. Backend Architecture
AI Agent Core

Responsible for:

Analyzing SaaS usage, user activity, and company data

Executing automated tasks (marketing, analytics, logistics)

Improving itself (self-aware logic for dev support)

Needs access to:

All Google APIs

Internal databases

Optional 3rd-party integrations (CRM, ERP, etc.)

Data Pipeline

Use Pub/Sub + Dataflow for real-time data ingestion.

Use BigQuery as the central analytics store.

Use Vertex AI for training predictive models.

Cloud Storage for raw data backups and logs.

Service Layer

REST API layer that:

Exposes endpoints for frontend to call

Handles token management

Ensures proper authorization for API requests

4. Frontend Architecture

Login page supporting:

Google OAuth sign-in

Native SaaS login

Dashboard for:

AI recommendations

Analytics overview

Marketing campaign management

Business operations insights

Admin panel for:

Managing users and permissions

Linking/unlinking Google accounts

Monitoring AI activity

5. Token & Credential Management

Service accounts:

Store JSON files securely

Used for automated API access

OAuth 2.0 tokens:

Refresh and store securely for each user

Secret Manager:

Use for database credentials, API keys, and sensitive tokens

6. API Integration Details

User-facing APIs:

Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Keep, Maps, People API

7. Testing & QA

Test OAuth login flows for multiple scenarios.

Test API access for each enabled scope.

Test AI agent operations with mock company data.

Test frontend dashboard with linked Google accounts.

Validate secure token storage and refresh mechanisms.

Include unit and integration tests for all major modules.

8. Deployment & Monitoring

Deploy backend services on Cloud Run or App Engine.

Deploy frontend as React/Vue/Next.js on Firebase Hosting or Cloud Storage + CDN.

Enable logging and monitoring:

Cloud Logging for backend

Cloud Monitoring dashboards for AI agent activity

Track:

API usage

Latency

Error rates

9. Optional Enhancements
