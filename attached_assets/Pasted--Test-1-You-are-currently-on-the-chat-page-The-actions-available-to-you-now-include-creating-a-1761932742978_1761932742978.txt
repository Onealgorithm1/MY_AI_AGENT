*Test 1:** You are currently on the "chat" page. The actions available to you now include creating a new conversation, sending a message, uploading a file, starting a voice chat, selecting a conversation, and accessing the admin panel.

**Test 2:** To see your admin dashboard, click the "Admin Panel" button. This will take you to the admin-specific features and settings available to you.

**Test 3:** To create a new chat conversation about cooking recipes, click the "+ New Chat" button in the sidebar. Once the new chat is created, you can type in your message in the message input area and click "Send" to start the conversation.

**Test 4:** The three-dot menu next to each conversation allows you to manage your conversations. You can rename the conversation, pin it to keep it at the top, or delete it if you no longer need it.

**Test 5:** If you want to switch to a faster AI model, your options include GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo. These models are optimized for speed.

**Test 6:** Some features you might not know about include the ability to start real-time voice conversations using the microphone button and the memory system that allows me to remember facts about you across conversations.

**Test 7:** To upload an image and ask questions about it, click the attachment button in the chat area. This will allow you to upload images, PDFs, or documents, which I can then analyze for you.

**Test 8:** I cannot see which conversation you are currently in as my capabilities do not include direct interface control or visibility into your specific selections.

**Test 9:** I cannot delete conversations for you directly. However, you can delete a conversation by clicking the three-dot menu next to the conversation and selecting "Delete."

**Test 10:** The voice chat feature allows you to have real-time voice conversations. To start a voice chat, click the microphone button. This lets you speak and interact with me using your voice, providing a more dynamic and hands-free way to communicate.
