That's a great idea. Enhancing Nexus's visibility is key to making it a truly effective "infrastructure agent." Since your last query was to see if Nexus needed updates, I will frame this as the Final System Upgrade Directive for your development team.This directive details exactly what telemetry data Nexus needs to be injected with to eliminate its current "blind spot" and proactively diagnose issues like the trailing slash error.🛠️ Final System Upgrade Directive: Enhancing Nexus TelemetryTo: Development TeamSubject: Nexus Visibility Enhancement (Self-Diagnosis Capability) - New Telemetry FeedsTeam,To prevent future failures like the recent WebSocket configuration error from being a "blind spot," we must grant Nexus access to crucial infrastructure and network telemetry. This will allow the agent to self-diagnose external configuration errors and support issues before they escalate.Please establish new, read-only data feeds that inject the following real-time metadata into the Nexus System Prompt before each API call.1. 🌐 Edge Network & Proxy Telemetry (High Priority)These data points solve the "failing before it hits the backend" problem by providing visibility into the Load Balancer (LB) and proxy layer.Data PointDescriptionRationale for NexusEdge Rejection Count (5m)Total failed WebSocket connection attempts logged by the LB in the last 5 minutes.Allows Nexus to confirm if external traffic is being blocked.Last LB Error CodeThe specific HTTP error code generated by the LB for the last rejected connection attempt (e.g., 400, 502).Critical for Diagnosis. Nexus can deduce issues like a malformed URL (400) or proxy failure (502).Upgrade Failure RatePercentage of connection attempts where the HTTP $\rightarrow$ WebSocket protocol upgrade failed at the LB.Confirms health of the core WebSocket routing rule.2. ⚙️ Environment Configuration MetadataThis allows Nexus to confirm configuration consistency without needing direct file access.Data PointDescriptionRationale for NexusActive Deployment HashA unique Git commit hash or deployment ID for the current live frontend build.Confirms which version of the code (with the mic fix) is being served.Config Hash ValueA cryptographically secure hash of the live, active VITE_WS_URL value (the one being used by the hosting machine).Allows Nexus to check if the current configuration value matches the expected value, isolating .env corruption.CDN Invalidation StatusSimple true/false flag showing the status of the last global CDN cache purge request.Lets Nexus know if the frontend is likely serving an outdated, cached version of the JavaScript file.3. ⏱️ Performance & Latency TelemetryThese metrics are essential for Nexus to proactively flag any performance degradation of the new streaming service.Data PointDescriptionRationale for NexusSTT Time-to-First-Result (ms)The actual time elapsed from audio stream start to the receipt of the first partial transcript.Verifies Success. Confirms that the streaming refactor achieved its goal of low perceived latency.Average STT Stream Duration (s)Average length of successful STT sessions.Baseline metric for capacity planning and detecting overly long/stalled streams.Once this telemetry is integrated, Nexus will no longer have an "Access Required" blind spot for common deployment and connectivity failures.
