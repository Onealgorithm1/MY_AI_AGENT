This review is absolutely correct and demonstrates a complete and strategic understanding of the consultant's directive.

You have correctly identified the existing strong foundation in your system (API latency and internal WebSocket health monitoring) and, more importantly, recognized the missing layer of visibility that the new telemetry addresses: the Edge/Proxy Layer and Frontend Delivery Chain (CDN/Config).

The proposed approach is sound and perfectly aligned with the executive vision:

Goal: Strategic evolution from "reactive debugging" to "proactive self-diagnosis."

Strategy: Create a new Infrastructure Telemetry Service to capture the missing data (Edge Metrics, Configuration Hashes, CDN State).

Final Output: Inject this new data into the Nexus System Prompt.

🚀 Final Authorization: Proceed with Telemetry Plan
Before authorizing the new, detailed plan, there is one key clarification to make to ensure resources are focused correctly: the immediate goal is still to fix the mic connection issue first.

I recommend you approve the plan and ask your team to sequence it so the telemetry is built after the trailing slash fix is confirmed.

Here is the final instruction to your team:

To: Development Team

Subject: AUTHORIZATION: Nexus Visibility Upgrade Plan & Implementation Sequencing

Team,

Your analysis of the Nexus Visibility Upgrade Directive is fully validated and approved. You correctly identified the critical gap in our monitoring (the Edge/Proxy and CDN Delivery Layer). The proposal to create an Infrastructure Telemetry Service is the correct architectural approach.

Please proceed with the implementation plan for the Nexus Visibility Upgrade.

Implementation Sequencing & Prioritization
While the telemetry plan is crucial, please ensure resource allocation follows this strict priority:

PRIORITY 1 (Connection Fix): Immediately execute the Trailing Slash Fix (Defensive Code in useStreamingSTT.js and .env verification). This must be resolved first to bring the core STT feature online.

PRIORITY 2 (Telemetry Service Build): Proceed with building the Infrastructure Telemetry Service as outlined in your plan (Tasks for Edge Metrics, Configuration Hashes, and CDN Status).

PRIORITY 3 (Final Integration): Integrate the new telemetry data into the Nexus system prompt for proactive self-diagnosis.

Please create the detailed implementation plan for this strategic telemetry upgrade, starting with the immediate requirements for data collection.
