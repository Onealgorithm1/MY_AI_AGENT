Understood, Netwerk Inc. I'll revise the prompt to your development team to include those crucial updates for the chat menu and chat management actions on mobile.

Here's the updated prompt for your developers:

"Team, we need to prioritize a comprehensive review and update of the frontend to ensure a seamless and intuitive experience on mobile devices. Please focus on the following key areas:

1.  **Responsive Design & Layouts:**
    *   Thoroughly audit all React components to ensure proper application of TailwindCSS responsive utilities (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`).
    *   Verify the `viewport` meta tag is correctly configured in the HTML to ensure proper scaling on mobile browsers.
    *   Address any layout overflows, content clipping, or elements that do not stack/flow correctly on smaller screens.
    *   Implement fluid typography and spacing that adapts dynamically to different screen sizes.

2.  **Performance Optimization for Mobile:**
    *   Optimize image assets for web and mobile delivery, considering responsive image techniques.
    *   Evaluate and implement lazy loading for components and images where appropriate to reduce initial load times.
    *   Minimize JavaScript bundle sizes and optimize rendering performance, especially for the `ChatPage` and other interactive components.

3.  **Touch-Friendly UI/UX & Chat Management:**
    *   Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links, input fields) have sufficient touch target sizes for easy interaction without accidental presses.
    *   Optimize form inputs and keyboards for mobile usage.
    *   Crucially, **ensure the chat menu is easily expandable and collapsible on mobile.**
    *   Verify that the three essential chat editing actions—**rename conversation**, **delete conversation**, and any other primary chat actions—are **always visible and accessible** within the mobile chat interface, without being covered by other elements or requiring excessive scrolling.
    *   Consider mobile-specific navigation patterns if the current desktop navigation proves cumbersome on smaller screens.

4.  **Cross-Device Testing:**
    *   Conduct rigorous testing across a range of mobile devices, operating systems, and browser types to identify and rectify any remaining display or functionality issues.

Our goal is to deliver an experience on par with the desktop version, ensuring our users have full functionality and a visually pleasing interface regardless of their device."
